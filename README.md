This is the Edureka certification project.

The Project is all about designing a model by analyzing the data to classify the customers who would want to buy the product or not. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Sampling the data and splitting into Train and Test Data.
3. Building the model using Logistic Regression
4. Predicting the model using the test data
5. Evaluating the performance of the model using the Confusion Matrix and ROCR Curve.
